This page allows ARL to upload employees through copy and paste or importing a csv file. This will insert the employees right into our NL_EMPLOYEE table.
This was achieved by creating a data loading page, and specifying which table the data is to be added to. We tested this feature by exporting a csv file of our employees,
changing a few values and uploading it using this feature. The employees then showed up on our Employee table.
